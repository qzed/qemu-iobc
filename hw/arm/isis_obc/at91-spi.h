/*
 * AT91 Serial Peripheral Interface.
 *
 * Emulation of devices connected to the SPI is done via outside processes
 * communicating via the IOX server (for details see ioxfer-server.h). The
 * socket address can be set via the "socket" property (as is done and defined
 * in iobc_board.c).
 *
 * Multiple operations are possible via the IOX server. For data transfer
 * these are:
 * - Transfer data from AT19 to client process (category IOX_CAT_DATA, ID
 *   IOX_CID_DATA_OUT, Payload contains raw data).
 * - Transfer data from client process to AT91 (category IOX_CAT_DATA, ID
 *   IOX_CID_DATA_IN, payload contains raw data).
 * Particular care should be taken regarding the synchronous transmit/receive
 * nature of the SPI interface: SPI tranfers can only read and write at the
 * same time, meaning when data is being sent by the AT91, it intrinsically
 * receives the same amount of data at the same time. Due to this, as soon as
 * the AT91 (master mode) initiates a data transfer (sends data), the
 * emulation is paused until the client has sent back the same amount of data,
 * which is considered to be read during the transmit operation. Failure of
 * the client to send this data will block the emulation. Excess data is
 * ignored. In essence, a client for the AT91 SPI in master mode should always
 * follow up a data frame receival by sending the exact same amount of data
 * back.
 *
 * As due to the different nature of the transport it is not possible to
 * emulate all failure modes and flags. Thus a mechanism for fault injection
 * is provided, allowing to set
 * - MODF (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_MODF)
 * - OVRES (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_OVRES)
 *
 * Additional notes:
 * - Master clock of AT91 must be set/updated via at91_spi_set_master_clock.
 *
 * See at91-spi.c for implementation status.
