/*
 * AT91 Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.
 *
 * Emulation of devices connected to the USART is done via outside processes
 * communicating via the IOX server (for details see ioxfer-server.h). The
 * socket address can be set via the "socket" property (as is done and defined
 * in iobc_board.c).
 *
 * Multiple operations are possible via the IOX server. For data transfer
 * these are:
 * - Transfer data from AT19 to client process (category IOX_CAT_DATA, ID
 *   IOX_CID_DATA_OUT, Payload contains raw data).
 * - Transfer data from client process to AT91 (category IOX_CAT_DATA, ID
 *   IOX_CID_DATA_IN, payload contains raw data).
 * In case of transmission from client to AT91, the IOX server sends a
 * response with a 32 bit little-endian status code. Currently this code can
 * be one of the following Unix/Linux error codes:
 * - ENXIO: The USART receiver has not been enabled on the AT91.
 * - 0: Success.
 *
 * As due to the different nature of the transport it is not possible to
 * emulate all failure modes and flags. Thus a mechanism for fault injection
 * is provided, allowing to set
 * - OVRE (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_OVRE)
 * - FRAME (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_FRAME)
 * - PARE (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_PARE)
 * - TIMEOUT (category IOX_CAT_FAULT, ID IOX_CID_FAULT_TIMEOUT)
 *
 * Note especially that, since the receiver timeout can not be emulated, it is
 * imperative to inject this timeout manually if communication relies on it.
 * This is the case when a receive operation is started with a buffer that may
 * be larger than the expected length of the data to be recieved. In this case
 * one would rely on the timeout to detect the end of the
 * data-frame/transmission burst. This detection cannot be reliably emulated
 * and thus the timeout has to be manually fault-injected by the sender/client
 * after the data transmission has been completed.
 *
 * Additional notes:
 * - Master clock of AT91 must be set/updated via at91_usart_set_master_clock.
 *
 * See at91-usart.c for implementation status.
