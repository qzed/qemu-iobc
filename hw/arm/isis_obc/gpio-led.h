/*
 * Simple emulated LED.
 *
 * Simulates a single LED accessible via a GPIO, which outputs its state on
 * change to the QEMU log. The GPIO is a named IRQ line ("led") and controlls
 * the state of the LED (on/off). Connect this GPIO to control the LED, e.g.
 * via a the push-button emulation. The LED can be given a name via the "name"
 * property.
 *
 * Useful for the AT91 getting-started example. Currently not added to the
 * board.
